<h1>Engine data recorder.</h1>

<p>The aim of this small project was to make an engine speed recorder, that will record the rpm of the engine, and the period of each rotation.</p>
<p>The rotation is being measured by the use of encoder. It has A, ~A, B, ~B, VCC, GND and a signle-rotation single wire, that emmits the signal each time there is a full-rotation.</p>
